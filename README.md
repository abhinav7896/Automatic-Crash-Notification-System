# Automatic-Crash-Notification-System

->Used ESP8266 Wi-Fi SoC that contains TCP/IP stack and a microcontroller. It was flashed with firmware written in C++, using Arduino IDE. The firmware configures the SoC in STA (station) mode and connects it to the access point on driverâ€™s mobile phone (personal hotspot).

->The crash sensors and the GPS module in the vehicle are interfaced to the microcontroller. The firmware reads the GPS and posts the coordinates to the PHP service on a remote WAMP server, in the event of an accident, which inserts the coordinates into the table in MySQL database.

->Another PHP service retrieves the coordinates from the MySQL database and pushes a notification to the users who monitor the application (eg: police or emergency services department).
