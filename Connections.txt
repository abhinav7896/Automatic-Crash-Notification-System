Connections :


Crash sensor        ESP8266

Vcc                 3.3V out
GND                 GND
OUT                 D4(GPIO 2)

Crash sensor is connected to the D4 pin which serves as a GPIO(General Purpose I/O) 2




GPS                 ESP8266

Vcc                 3.3V out
TX                  D7(RXD2)
RX                  D8(TXD2)
GND                 GND

GPS module is connected at the third serial port(TXD2, RXD2), as the first serial port
(TX0, RX0) is used for the USB communication with a PC to show the output and the second 
serial port's transmitter(TX1) is overlapped with the GPIO2 pin, which has been used for 
the crash sensor.Given below is the detailed pin diagram of ESP8266;
